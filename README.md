# Image2PDFConverter
Converts image(s) into a single PDF

## Description
A concept for a very simple Image to PDF converter.  

**Usage:** DL the standalone executeable. PDF's will be saved to the same dir.  
**Requirements:** Python 3.8
**Note:** This is currently a quick mockup that eventually will get ported over to a Flask website. So the GUI is placeholder, and so is most of the code.
